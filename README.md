# MBO Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 21, 2025**

[Steve Sheridan] ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information in connection with the SportsBet Manager mobile application ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
The App allows you to track betting activities, including amounts, teams, and outcomes. All data you enter is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties. We collect:

- **User-Provided Data**: Information you input, such as betting amounts, team selections, and transaction details (e.g., deposits, withdrawals). This data is stored locally on your device using the App’s internal storage system.
- **Automatically Collected Data**: The App does not collect any data automatically, such as device information, usage data, or location.
- **Third-Party Data**: The App does not integrate with third-party services or share data with external entities.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
The data you enter is used solely to provide the App’s functionality, including:
- Tracking and displaying your betting transactions and profit/loss.
- Calculating recovery amounts for betting strategies.
- Generating local graphs and summaries within the App.

We do not use your data for analytics, advertising, or any purpose beyond the App’s core features.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
All data entered in the App is stored locally on your device. We do not store or process your data on our servers or in the cloud. You are responsible for securing your device to protect your data. We implement reasonable security measures within the App to prevent unauthorized access, but no system is completely secure.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties. Your data remains on your device and is not transmitted externally.

## 5. Your Rights
As the App stores data locally:
- You can access or delete your data by managing transactions within the App (e.g., removing bets in the Wagers tab or clearing data in the Bank tab).
- If you uninstall the App, all data stored locally will be deleted.

For users in the European Union (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you have rights to access, delete, or restrict data processing. Since we do not collect or process personal data beyond local storage, these rights are managed directly through your device.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for users under 17. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child under 17 has used the App, please contact us to delete their data.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted at [Your Privacy Policy URL] with a revised “Last Updated” date. Please check periodically for changes.

## 8. Contact Us
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
